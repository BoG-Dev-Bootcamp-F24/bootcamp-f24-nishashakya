## Instructions
In this exercise, you will choose an api from the list of public apis and create a Postman collection to send some requests to it. https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file
For HTTP requests that are not generally supported by public apis (DELETE), play around with https://httpbin.org/#/HTTP_Methods/ which allows you to see exactly what the server gets from your request. 

**Requirements:**
- Make at least 1 different requests of each type
- GET request
- GET request with a path parameter (ie /cats/:tag)
- GET request with a query parameter (ie /dog?breed=rotweiler)
- POST request with a json request body
- DELETE request with a path parameter (ie /cat/:id)
